# Flight Crew Management Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Flight Crew Management Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository.  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution for airline operations, from raw data ingestion to analytics-ready reporting. Designed as a portfolio project, it follows industry best practices in data engineering, data modeling, and SQL analytics.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**  
   Stores raw airline operational data as-is from source CSV files. Data is ingested into a SQL Server database without transformation.

2. **Silver Layer**  
   Applies data cleansing, standardization, deduplication, and business rule validation to prepare high-quality, conformed datasets.

3. **Gold Layer**  
   Contains analytics-ready data modeled using a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytical queries.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**  
   Designing a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

2. **ETL Pipelines**  
   Extracting, transforming, and loading airline operational data into SQL Server.

3. **Data Modeling**  
   Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

4. **Analytics and Reporting**  
   Creating SQL-based analytical queries to generate actionable operational insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern SQL Server–based data warehouse to consolidate flight operations, crew management, delays, and weather data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications

- **Data Sources**  
  Import multiple airline operational datasets provided as CSV files:
  - Flights
  - Airports
  - Aircraft
  - Crew
  - Crew assignments
  - Delay events
  - Weather windows

- **Data Quality**  
  Cleanse and resolve data quality issues, including:
  - Duplicate records
  - Inconsistent date and timestamp formats
  - Invalid airport codes
  - Cancelled flights with actual timestamps
  - Negative or malformed delay values
  - Overlapping or invalid crew duty windows

- **Integration**  
  Combine all datasets into a single analytical data model:
  - Flights linked to routes, airports, aircraft, and dates
  - Crew assignments linked to flights and crew members
  - Delay events linked to standardized delay categories
  - Weather windows linked to impacted airports

- **Scope**  
  - Focus on the latest 24 months of data (approximately 50,000 flights)
  - No historization or slowly changing dimensions required
  - Retain the most recent valid record when duplicates exist

- **Documentation**  
  Provide clear documentation for data architecture, data models, and transformation logic to support analytics and business users.

### BI and Analytics (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver insights into:

- Flight on-time performance
- Crew utilization and duty hours
- Delay root cause analysis
- Route, airport, and hub performance

These insights support operational monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
